// Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners
// about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For
// now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy.
//     A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years
// old.
//     Your tasks:
//     Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages
// ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
//     1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have
// cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat
// ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function
// parameters)
// 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
// 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1
// is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy
// üê∂
// ")
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets
// Test data:
//     ¬ß Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// ¬ß Data 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

// Coding Challenge #2
// Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert
// dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
//     Your tasks:
//     Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
// ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
// 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is
// <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
//     humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4
// 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as
// keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
// 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know
// from other challenges how we calculate averages üòâ)
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets
// Test data:
//     ¬ß Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// ¬ß Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

// Coding Challenge #4
// Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying if dogs are
// eating too much or too little.
//     Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than the
// recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.
//     Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a range 10%
// above and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).
// Your tasks:
//     1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate
// the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do
// not create a new array, simply loop over the array. Forumla:
// recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of
// food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
// 2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too
// little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in
// the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose) ü§ì
// 3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much
// ('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little
// ('ownersEatTooLittle').
// 4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this: "Matilda and
// Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat
// too little!"
// 5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food
// that is recommended (just true or false)
// 6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food
// (just true or false)
// 7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of food (try
// to reuse the condition used in 6.)
// 8. Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food
// portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the
// array's objects üòâ)
// The Complete JavaScript Course 26
// Hints:
//     ¬ß Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use the summary
// lecture to choose between them üòâ
// ¬ß Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion means:
//     current > (recommended * 0.90) && current < (recommended *
//         1.10). Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the
// recommended portion.

// Test data:
